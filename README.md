# Monopoly Game (Java)

This project is a simplified Monopoly-style board game implemented in Java. I built it for my CIS-296 course, and I’m sharing it here as part of my portfolio. The game lets players move around the board, buy properties, pay rent, and save or load their progress.

---

### How the Game Works: 
- Players take turns rolling dice
- Each dice roll moves a player around the board
- Landing on:
1. Unowned property → player can buy it.
2. Owned property → pay rent
- Supports saving and loading the game using a text file
- Uses basic OOP design with clean classes for Player, Board, Property, etc.

### Features: 
- Player movement and turn logic
- Property buying and rent calculation
- Saving and loading game state
- Simple command-line game loop
- Object-oriented structure

### How to Run:
- Open a terminal inside the src/ folder
- Compile all Java files: "javac *.java"
- Run the main program: "java Main"

### Notes: 

This project helped me practice Java fundamentals such as classes, file handling, loops, and basic game logic. Overall, I am confident that my project demonstrates my ability to work with Java classes, loops, conditions, and file handling to build a functional program. I think generally it was a good challenge, and I learned a lot while completing it.
