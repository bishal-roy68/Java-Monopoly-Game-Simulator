# Monopoly Game (Java)

This project is a simplified, text-based Monopoly game developed in Java. I originally created it for my CIS-296 Java Programming course, and I’m sharing it here as part of my portfolio. The game implements the fundamental mechanics of Monopoly, including player turns, dice rolls, property ownership, rent calculations, and game state management, all structured using clean object-oriented design. It also includes the ability to save and load game progress, allowing players to continue their session at any time.

### How the Game Works: 
- Players take turns rolling dice
- Each dice roll moves a player around the board
- Landing on:
    - Unowned property → player can buy it.
    - Owned property → pay rent
- Supports saving and loading the game using a text file
- Uses basic OOP design with clean classes for Player, Board, Property, etc.

### Features: 
- Player movement and turn logic
- Property buying and rent calculation
- Saving and loading game state
- Simple command-line game loop
- Object-oriented structure

### How to Run:
- Open a terminal inside the src/ folder
- Compile all Java files: "javac *.java"
- Run the main program: "java Main"

### Notes: 

This project helped me practice Java fundamentals such as classes, file handling, loops, and basic game logic. Overall, I am confident that my project demonstrates my ability to work with Java classes, loops, conditions, and file handling to build a functional program. I think generally it was a good challenge, and I learned a lot while completing it.
